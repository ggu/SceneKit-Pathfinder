        These nodes are to be removed from the pathfinding graph, since walls
        are impassible.
    
        This maze generation algorithm uses a depth-first search (DFS).
        It uses a stack to track its progress through the maze, and an array
        to check how much of the maze it has visited. It works like this:
        the starting node is added to the stack and array. The algorithm
        selects a node neighboring the top node of the stack (the starting
        node, in this case). It then removes the wall separating those two
        nodes, and adds the neighboring node to the stack and array. This
        process continues until the top node of the stack has no unvisited
        neighbors. When what happens, the algorithm removes nodes from the
        stack until the top node has an unvisited neighbor, and the process
        continues. Eventually the entire maze will have been visited, the
        stack will be empty, and the maze is created.
        
        Instead of removing walls directly, this method keeps track of
        which walls need to be removed, and returns those nodes.
